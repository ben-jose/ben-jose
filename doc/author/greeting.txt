Yashua Melej Hamashiaj.
Shalom Aleijem.

My name is Jose Luis Quiroga and
I am the author of this software library
to solve SAT problems.

This library of free software is my gift to you.
At the same time is the testimony of my greatest merit:

Thank Yahwe, our Father of the heavens,
for letting me recognize you as my brother and
Yashua as our anointed king.

Greetings with faith in the biblical promises of Yahwe so
that in the future, after the thousand years kingdom of Yashua
from the temple described in Ezequiel,
we are all resurrected, we all recognize us as brothers, and
peace reigns for ever between us.

Shalom ubraja.
